# Hyperledger-parblockchain
The unique features of blockchain such as transparency, provenance, fault tolerance, and authenticity are used by many systems to deploy a wide range of distributed applications such as supply chain management and healthcare in a permissioned setting. Distributed applications, however, require high performance in terms of throughput and latency. The performance aspect of permission blockchains has been addressed in several studies such as Hyperledger Fabric and ParBlockchain. The goal of this project is to improve the performance of Hyperledger Fabric using the technique that has been presented in ParBlockchain permissioned blockchain.
